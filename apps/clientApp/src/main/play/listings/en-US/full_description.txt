Bisq Connect is a lightweight utility app that allows users to securely connect to a trusted Bisq2 Node. By scanning a QR
  code generated by your node, you can establish a direct and private communication channel — no more manually typing        
  addresses and passwords.                                                                                                 

  Key Features:

  - QR Code Pairing: Scan a QR code from your Bisq2 node to connect instantly. The QR code securely encodes the connection
  address, encryption credentials, and a one-time pairing token that expires after 5 minutes.
  - Multiple Connection Modes: Connect over your local WiFi (LAN) with TLS encryption and certificate pinning, or remotely
  over Tor with optional client authentication for maximum privacy.
  - Session-Based Authentication: After pairing, the app uses session tokens instead of passwords. No plaintext credentials
  are stored or transmitted.
  - Automatic Profile Sync: Your Bisq2 profiles are fetched automatically from your trusted node — no separate setup required
   on mobile.
  - Privacy-Preserving: The app does not store, track, or share any user data. All connections are encrypted: TLS for local
  networks, Tor for remote access.
  - Lightweight & Efficient: Designed for minimal CPU, battery, and data usage while providing a seamless connection
  experience.
  - User-Controlled Access: You choose which node to connect to, ensuring complete control over your connections.

  Bisq Connect is a utility tool meant to facilitate node interaction and enhance accessibility within the Bisq ecosystem.

  Requirements:
  - A Bisq2 node running on your computer or server
  - Android 7.0+ (SDK 24)
