Bisq Connect is a utility app that enables users to securely connect to their trusted Bisq Node via WebSocket. It serves as a remote interface to interact with the Bisq decentralized Bitcoin exchange network through a node you control and trust.

PURPOSE:
This app requires connection to a self-hosted Bisq node (Bisq 2 desktop) to function. Users establish a secure, encrypted connection by entering a pairing code provided by their node administrator (or scanning a QR code). The app provides remote access to view market data, monitor trades, and manage offers—all without storing any data on third-party servers.

KEY FEATURES:
• Secure WebSocket connection to your trusted Bisq node
• Server-controlled configuration via pairing code
• Privacy-first design — no data tracking or third-party servers
• Built-in Tor support for enhanced privacy
• View market offers, monitor trades, and manage your Bisq activity remotely
