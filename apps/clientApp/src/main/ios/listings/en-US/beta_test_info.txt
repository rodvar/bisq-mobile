Bisq Connect is a utility app that enables users to securely connect to their trusted Bisq Node via WebSocket. It serves as a remote interface to interact with the Bisq decentralized Bitcoin exchange network through a node you control and trust.

PURPOSE:
This app requires connection to a self-hosted Bisq node (Bisq 2 desktop) to function. Users establish a secure, encrypted connection by entering a pairing code provided by their node administrator (or scanning a QR code). The app provides remote access to view market data, monitor trades, and manage offers—all without storing any data on third-party servers.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR APP REVIEWERS:
To evaluate the app without connecting to a live node, please use DEMO MODE:

1. When prompted for the pairing code on first launch, enter: BISQ_DEMO_PAIRING_CODE
2. This activates a demonstration environment with simulated data
3. Demo mode uses fake/sample data and some features have minimal or disabled functionality (e.g., creating offers, push notifications, and certain trade actions are limited or unavailable)

Demo mode is provided solely for App Store review purposes to showcase the app's interface and core functionality without requiring a live Bisq node connection.

KEY FEATURES:
• Secure WebSocket connection to your trusted Bisq node
• Server-controlled configuration via pairing code
• Privacy-first design — no data tracking or third-party servers
• Built-in Tor support for enhanced privacy
• View market offers, monitor trades, and manage your Bisq activity remotely
