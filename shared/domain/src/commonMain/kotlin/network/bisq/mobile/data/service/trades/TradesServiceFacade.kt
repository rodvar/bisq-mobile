 * have synced without it, which means genuinely absent, or once the sync has failed and is not coming;
 * both are what the callers' not-found dialog is for. The wait has no bound: the data layer knows
 * when the trades have arrived and when they are not going to, and a duration would only be wrong in
 * one of the two directions.
 *
 * The lookup is local and the selection happens once, at the end: selecting on every emission would
 * write the shared [TradesServiceFacade.selectedTrade] for every waiter, and two screens waiting on
 * different trades (a deep link and a chat notification) would overwrite each other's selection while
 * the trade actions all read that one global.
