/**
 * Single source of truth for which Community hub segments are live, and for the hub's
 * aggregate unread count.
 *
 * Every segment ships in every build — the per-app rollout property that staged them was removed
 * once all three were implemented — so liveness is the capability filter alone: the per-segment
 * backend requirement ([REQUIRED_FEATURES]) checked against the trusted node's capability
 * manifest, fail closed — the same gating the rest of the app uses via
 * [BackendCapabilitiesService]. A segment with no entry has no backend dependency. On the NODE
 * app this filter passes by construction: requirements are typed [Feature] entries and the
 * node's config facade reports the full Feature key set (it runs the core in-process). There is
 * deliberately no per-device grant filter: every API permission the segments ride on is STANDARD
 * (covered by any pairing), so node capability alone decides — same as closed trades.
