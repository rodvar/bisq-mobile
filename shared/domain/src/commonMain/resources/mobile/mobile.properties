They can only help the traders to come to a cooperative resolution.\n  - In case of clear evidence for a scam or severe violation of the trade rules the mediator can ban the misbehaving trader and in case that the trader was the Bitcoin seller and used 'account age' or 'signed account age witness' as reputation source, they will also get banned on Bisq 1. If the seller has used 'bonded BSQ' as reputation source the mediator will report the incident to the DAO and make a proposal for confiscating their bonded BSQ.
