  ExportOptions for EU Distribution via App Store Connect (Notarization Only)

  Note on uploadSymbols=false:
  dSYM files won't be uploaded to App Store Connect during export. This means:
  - Crashes in Xcode Organizer / App Store Connect will appear unsymbolicated
  - If using third-party crash reporters (e.g., Sentry), upload dSYMs separately
  - For local debugging, dSYMs are still generated in the archive
